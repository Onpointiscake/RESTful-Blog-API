# RESTful Blog API

My custom way of converting a csv to a json file (an assignment of EdxÂ´s course 'Introduction to Node.js')

## Routes

- GET and POST /posts
- PUT and DELETE /posts/:postId/
- GET and POST /posts/:postId/comments
- PUT and DELETE /posts/:postId/comments/commentId

## Things Learned!

- Use module.exports to export the functions created for posts and comments
- How to when removing a blog post all its comments also get removed
- Using require to import posts and comments functions
